# Arrays-ArrayLists
This project was for implementing Arrays and ArrayLists in java, while studying a java object oriented programming course.

# INSTRUCTIONS
In this assignment, you will implement a class called ​ ArrayAndArrayList​ . This class includes some interesting methods for working with Arrays and ArrayLists.

For example, the ​ ArrayAndArrayList​ class has a “findMax” method which finds and returns the max number in a given array. For a defined array: int[] array = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, calling findMax(array) will return 9.

There are 4 methods that need to be implemented in the ArrayAndArrayList​ class:
- howMany(int[] array, int element) - Counts the number of occurrences of the given
element in the given array.
- findMax(int[] array) - Finds the max number in the given array.
- maxArray(int[] array) - Keeps track of every occurrence of the max number in the given
array.
- swapZero(int[] array) - Puts all of the zeros in the given array, at the end of the given
array. The method updates the array itself
